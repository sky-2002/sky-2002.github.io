Welcome to this blog!

I'm Aakash. I am a Btech student in Data science and AI at IIT Bhilai. I am passionate about open source and like to explore NLP, graph ML and Databases.

I created this blog to share what I am learning, write about and keep track of my GSoC project and about anything new that I come across.
