<!-- #### **Introduction** -->
Welcome to this blog!

I'm Aakash. 
I am a Btech student in Data science and AI at IIT Bhilai. I am passionate about open source. Like to explore NLP, graph ML and Databases.

I created this blog to share what I am learning, write about and keep track of my GSoC project and about anything new that I come across.



#### **Open source highlights**
- Added [new distance metrics](https://weaviate.io/blog/weaviate-1-15-release#new-distance-metrics) to weaviate. 
- Added [approx-KNN graph](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/7421) to pytorch-geometric.
- Contributed an example application - [an attendance system](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples/tree/main/attendance-system-example) - using a vector DB. It was also used by their GSoC contributor that year.
- Contributed a [multi-modal search example](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples/tree/main/exploring-multi2vec-clip-with-Python-and-flask) which was also used in their GSoC project.
