<!-- #### **Introduction** -->

I'm Aakash. 
I am a Btech student in Data science and AI at IIT Bhilai. I am passionate about open source. I find NLP, graph ML and Databases interesting.

I had created this blog during my GSoC to keep track of my progress. Now I plan to use it to document 
my work, which I can refer back to.


#### **Open source highlights**
- Created a [smart query routing](https://github.com/NeumTry/NeumAI/pull/61) method to route query to most relevant sink in Neum AI.
- Implemented [BLEU](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/pull/443) and [METEOR](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/pull/457) metrics for machine translation in UpTrain AI.
- Expanded filtering in Neum AI by adding [unified filter](https://github.com/NeumTry/NeumAI/pull/41).
- Integrated [LanceDB sink](https://github.com/NeumTry/NeumAI/pull/40) and [Marqo sink](https://github.com/NeumTry/NeumAI/pull/35) to Neum AI.
- Integrated marqo tensor search as [retrieval mechanism in dspy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/pull/216).
- Implemented [new distance metrics](https://weaviate.io/blog/weaviate-1-15-release#new-distance-metrics) to weaviate. 
- Developed [approx-KNN based graph construction](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/pull/7421) to pytorch-geometric.
- Developed an example application - [an attendance system](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples/tree/main/attendance-system-example) - using a vector DB. It was also used by their GSoC contributor that year.
- Developed a [multi-modal search example](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples/tree/main/exploring-multi2vec-clip-with-Python-and-flask) which was also used in their GSoC project.
